# No name for now
This project doesn't have a name yet but it's about magic and wizards

# Branches
This github page is organized in four branches [main]() [client]() [server]() and [cosmos](). Each one of them represents a different part of the project. 

## Main
The branch where all relevant information is
## Client
The client for the game (the actual game will also have a server, because singleplayer uses a local server)
## Server
A server for the game (UDP)
## Cosmos
A server for the cosmos mechanic (TCP)
